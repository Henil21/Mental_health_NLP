# Mental_health_NLP
Mental_health_NLP is built upon machine learning algorithms and NLP techniques to classify text data into binary mental health categories. It can be used to analyze and understand the sentiment and context of mental health-related text samples, such as social media posts, blog articles, or patient reviews.

The project utilizes a binary classification model implemented with TensorFlow. The model is trained on a labeled dataset that includes text samples labeled as 0 for "Positive Mental Health" and 1 for  "Negative Mental Health." The trained model can predict the category of a given text input, indicating whether it aligns with positive or negative mental health.
